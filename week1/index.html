MASTER MOBILE UX
	• Rewire your brain
		○ Think simple and beautiful 
		○ More devices to make work today
		○ Do mobile first and then fix it for a computer
			§ Helps plan for future and growth
			§ Helps concentrate on content
			§ Easier to grow rather than shrink
		○ People don’t know what they want until you show them
			§ Be there - help someone along their journey and deepen their loyalty
			§ Be useful - satisfy needs
			§ Be quick - good functionality
		○ Reachability
			§ Be aware that people use their thumbs and only one handed, design things that can be done with one hand or finger
			§ Networks matter - not everyone has the best and greatest
				□ Reduce image usage or use svg/webfonts for lower bandwidth
				□ Optimize and minify css and js files - remove unused things
				□ Gzip to eliminate unnecessary data
		○ Be empathetic to user needs
			§ Make primary controls in easy to reach areas - near the bottom of the screen where people hold phones
			§ Keep it simple!
			§ Placement matters
				□ Controls at the bottom
				□ Address reachability which increases the perception of speed
		○ Keep design intuitive and mobile friendly
			§ Forms
				□ Display labels inside the text box to reduce the space 
				□ Float labels!
				□ Large boxes to make clicking easier 
				□ Can enable auto complete
				□ When taking numbers - just open the number pad
		○ Mobile advertising
			§ Before you advertise, research
			§ Pop ups are not good, hinder more than help
			§ Place what they want to know at the top and place adds farther down, small and simple
			§ Try a small video add instead of a large picture
			§ Things to remember
				□ Don’t use pop ups and pop overs
				□ Users don’t visit to look at ads, they come for content
				□ Simple and sleek
				□ Content comes first, keep ads non distracting 
				□ Empathy is huge
