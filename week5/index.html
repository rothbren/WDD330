    Testing and debugging
    Errors, exceptions, and warnings
        • Errors can be caused by:
            ○ System error - problem with system or external device
            ○ Programmer error - incorrect syntax or faulty logic, typos
            ○ User error - when user enters data incorrectly 
        • Exceptions
            ○ Exception: an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with an error 
            ○ Example: trying to call something that is not there
            ○ Stack traces
                § Sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred
                § Will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method
        • Warnings
            ○ Occur when there is an error in the code, but doesn’t cause code to crash
        • Importance of testing and debugging 
            ○ Javascript alerts errors instead of shutting down the program
            ○ Strict mode - produces exceptions and warnings 
            ○ Considers coding practices that were previously accepted as poor styling 
            ○ Increases the chance of errors, but it makes it easy to spot errors early on
            ○ Write this in the JavaScript file: 'use strict';
            ○ If strict mode is not supported, it will just be ignored
            ○ Can invoke strict mode to place all code in self invoking function
            
            (function() {
                'use strict';
            
                // All your code would go inside this function
            
            }());
        • Linting tools
            ○ Linting tools - JS link, JS hint, and ES lint
            ○ Used to test quality of JavaScript
            ○ Highlight sloppy code
            ○ Unforgiving 
            ○ Good for working as a team so everyone follows the same conventions
            ○ There is a plugin -- will highlight sloppy code and you type
            ○ Creates consistency
        • Feature detection 
            ○ Some browsers support things that others don’t 
            ○ Use if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to call the method
            
            if (window.holoDeck) {
                virtualReality.activate();
            }
            ○ Ensures no error occurs if the browser doesn’t support the method
            ○ Modernizer - offers easy way to implement feature detection
        • Debugging in the browser
            ○ Find where the bug is and fix it
            ○ Sometimes where the error occurred is not where the problem is
            ○ Use breakpoints to halt the program and run one thing at a time
            ○ alert()
                § Show a dialog at certain points in the code
            ○ Console 
                § Provides a number of methods for logging info and debugging
                §  console.log()  
            ○ Debugging tools
                § Allow you to set breakpoints
                § Debugger  key word
            ○ Error objects
                § Created by host environment when exception occurs
                §  const error = new Error()
            ○ Errors
                § EvalErroris not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the globaleval()function.
                § RangeErroris thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.
                § ReferenceErroris thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.
                § SyntaxErroris thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.
                § TypeErroris thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.
                § URIErroris thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.
                § InternalErroris a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.

            ○ Throwing exceptions
                §  throw - will allow for any problems in your code to be highlighted and dealt with
                § Can be applied to any JavaScript expression
                    □ Causes the execution of the program to stop
        • Exception handling
            ○ Program terminates with an error message when exception occurs 
            ○ Allows us to identify and fix erros
            ○ Try, catch, and finally
                § Try - will run the code inside the block as normal
                    □ If exception occurs it will pass the error that is thrown onto a catch block
                § Catch - will run if an exception is thrown inside the try blcok
                    □ Allows us to query the error name, message, and properties 
                § Finally - can be added after a catch block
                    □ Will always be executed after try or catch
                    □ Will run whether or not exception occurred
        • Tests
            ○ Test early means identifying errors early
            ○ Test Driven Development (TDD) - process of writing tests before actual code
                § Tests will fail when there is no code to test
                § Continual tests with each stage
            ○ Work flow
                § Write tests
                § Write code to pass the tests
                § Refactor the code
                § Test refactored code
                § Write more tests for new features
            ○ Testing frameworks
                § Provide a structure to write meaningful tests and then run them
                § Jest
                    □ Framework created by facebook
                    □ Makes it easy to cerate and run tests
                    □ Install jest
                        ®  in command terminal type: npm intall -g jest
    Chapter Summary
            ○ Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.
            ○ JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string"use strict". This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.
            ○ Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.
            ○ Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.
            ○ The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.
            ○ Exceptions can be thrown using thethrowstatement.
            ○ An error object is created when an exception occurs.
            ○ Any code placed inside atryblock will pass any error objects to acatchblock when an exception occurs. Any code inside afinallyblock will run if an exception does or does not occur.
            ○ Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.
            ○ The Jest framework can be used to test your code
