        Javascript basics
	• Objects - created to represent entities of the real world 
		○ Example - users, orders
		○ Let user = {name: "john", age:30};
		○ A user can act or select something and make something happen
			§ Add to a shopping cart or log out
		○ Method-a function that is a property of an object
			§ Object oriented programming (OOP) - write code using objects to represent entities
			§  this
				□ Used to call the method
				□ Let user = {
					Name: "john",
					Age: 30,
					
					sayHi() {
						//"this" is the "current object"
						Alert(this.name)
					}
				};
				User.sayHi(); //john 
			§ "this" is not bound
				□ Can be used in any function
				□ Can alert without an object but it will be undefined
				□ Arrow functions have no this
	• Summary
		○ Functions are stored in object properties called methods
		○ Methods allow objects to act like an object.doSomething()
		○ Methods can reference the object 'this'
		○ Value of 'this' is defined at run-time
			§ When function is declared, it can use 'this' but this has no value until the function is called
			§ Function can be copied between objects
			§ Function is called in the method syntax, object.method(); the value of this during the call is object

	• "this"
		○ Keyword whose value changes depending on how a function gets called
		○ 6 different ways to call
			§ Global context, object construction, object method, simple function, arrow function, event listener
		○ Global context
			§ Defaults to the window object in the browser when called outside any function
		○ Object construction
			§ When you create an object with the "new" keyword, "this" refers to the instance
		○ Object method
			§ Functions that are associated with an object
			§ This within any method refers to the object itself
		○ Simple function
			§ Function hello() {
				//say hello!
			}
		○ Arrow function
			§ Always the same as "this"
			§ Context stays as the object
			§ Leave function out of the declaration
			§ Create them directly as an argument
			§ Add =>
			§ It can change the number of arguments required and whether you like an implicit return
			§ Number of arguments
				□ One argument - you can remove the () 
				□ No arguments - you can substitute the () for _
			§ Implicit return
				□ Automatically create a return keyword if the code is only on one line and not enclosed in a block
		○ Event listeners
			§ Set to the element that fired the event in an event listener
			§ To remove- the callback is passed as the second value needs to be named a function
			§ Value of this is called by the function that calls it
			§ Every function defines its own this value
			§ Fat arrow functions never gets bound to a new value
				□ This will always be the same value 
			§ Never want to use arrow functions to declare object methods
				□ Cant reference the object 
				□ May not want to use because it creates even listeners because this no longer bind the the element you attached your event listen to 
		○ Bind
			§ Allows you to change the 'this' context
			§ Takes any number of arguments and returns the bound function
				function sayThis () { console.log(this) } const boundFunc = sayThis.bind(/* arguments...*/)
				
				From <https://zellwk.com/blog/this/> 
				
			§ Doesn’t work with arrow functions
	• Default parameters
		○ Can add a = whenever we define parameter
			§ Automatically defaults to that value when the parameter is undefined
	• De-structuring 
		○ Way to get values out of arrays and objects
		○ Minor differences between array and objects
		○ Can create and assign variables with single line of code
			let { firstName, lastName } = Zell console.log(firstName) // Zell console.log(lastName) // Liew
		○ {} while declaring variables 
		○ If variable name is already used, cannot declare variable again
			§ Can rename variables while destructing with a colon :
			let { name: courseName } = course console.log(courseName) // JS Fundamentals for Frontend Developers // What ES6 does under the hood: let courseName = course.name
		○ Will return undefined if you try to destructor a variable that’s not contained within an object
		○ Can write default parameters for de-structured variables 
	• Destructuring arrays
		○ [] 
		○ Destructure
			§ Your first variable is the first item in the array
			§ Second variable is the second item in the array 
			§ Etc…
			let [one, two] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] console.log(one) // 1 console.log(two) // 2
		○ Extra variables will be undefined
			let [one, two, three] = [1, 2] console.log(one) // 1 console.log(two) // 2 console.log(three) // undefined
			
			From <https://zellwk.com/blog/es6/#arrow-functions> 
		○ Rest operator - console.log(rest) will show the rest of the array
	• Swapping variables with destructured arrays
		○ Inside of []
	• Destructuring arrays and objects while declaring functions
	• Rest parameter and spread operator 
		○ Signified with three dots
		○ Rest
			§ Take the rest of the stuff and pack it array into an array
			§ Converts a comma separated list of arguments into an array
			§ Can pack away the rest of the scores
			§ REST PARAMETER PACKS EVERYTHING INTO AN ARRAY
		○ Spread
			§ TAKES AN ARRAY AND SPREADS IT INTO A COMMA SEPARATED LIST OF ARGUMENTS
			§ Used to concatenate 
		○ Enhanced object literals
			§ Property value shorthands, method shorthands, ability to use computed property names
			§ Property value shorthands
				□ Can write only variable if your variable name matches your property name 
			§ Methods shorthands
				□ Can remove :function from method declaration and it will work like it used to
			§ Computed object property names
	• To create template literal, enclose strings with backticks
		○ Gain access to a special placeholder ${} 
	• Tags 
		○ Tags are functions that allow you manipulate the template literal
		
	• Summary
		○ This - crucial keyword
			§ Appears in frameworks 
			§ 6 different ways to use this

Chapter 5 - objects
	• Object literals 
		○ Object: self-contained set of related values and functions
			§ Act as collection of named properties 
			§ When you look up a property name and see a value
			§ Used to keep related info and functionality together 
			§ Object literal: an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties and methods in {}
				□ Allow objects to be created quickly without need for defining class
			§ Creating objects
				□ Enter {}
				□  const spiderman = {} or const spiderman = new object();
				□ 2nd method is not recamended 
		○ Method: when a property's value is a function
		○ Accessing properties 
			§ Can access using dot notation
				□ Superman.name
				<<'Superman'
			§ Bracket notation
				□  superman['name']
				<< 'Superman'
		○ Computed properties
			§ javaScript code can be placed inside [ ] and property key will be the return value
		○ Calling methods
			§ Can use dot or bracket notation 
			§ Same as invoking a function
			§ Place () after name
				□ Superman['fly']()
			§ Use in operator to see if object has a particular property
				□ 'city' in superman;
			§ See if its undefined 
				□ Superman.city !== undefined;
					<< false
			§ .hasOwnProperty(thing you are testing)
				□ To see if its has its own property and did not inherit it from another object
		○ Finding properties 
			§ For in loop
				□ For(const key in superman) { 
					Console.log(key + ": " + superman[key]); 
			§ Object.keys()
				□ Will return an array of all the keys of any object that is provided as an argument
			§ Object.values()
				□ Returns an array of all the objects values
		○ Adding properties
			§ Assign the value to a new property 
		○ Changing properties 
			§ Use assignment
			§ Superman['real name'] = 'Kal-El';
		○ Remove properties 
			§ Delete operator 
		○ Objects are assignment by reference
	• Objects as parameters to functions
		○ Object literal can be passed as a parameter to a function
		○ Named parameters
			§ Used when a function has a large amount of optional parameters
	• This
		○ Refers to the object that it is within
		○ Can be used to access objects properties 
	• Namespacing
		○ Object literal pattern
			§ Create an object literal that serves as the namespace and then adding any values as properties of that object
	• JSON
		○ Property names must be double quoted 
		○ Permitted values are double quoted string, numbers, true, false, null, arrays, and objects
		○ Functions are not permitted values
		
		const batman = '{"name": "Batman","real name": "Bruce Wayne","height": 74, "weight": 210, "hero": true, "villain": false, "allies": ["Robin","Batgirl","Superman"]}'

		○ Parse()
			§ Takes a string of data and returns object
		○ Stringify()
			§ Takes a object and returns a string
	• Math object

		Math.PI // The ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle
		<< 3.141592653589793
		
		Math.SQRT2 // The square root of 2
		<< 1.4142135623730951

			§  math.abs(3) >>>>>>> 3
		○ Rounding numbers - math.ceil()
		○ Powers and roots
			§ Math.exp(), Math.pow(), Math.sqrt(), Math.cbrt() cuberoot
	• Date object
		○ Info about date and time
		○  const today = new Date( );
			Today.toString( );
			
			>> 'Tue Feb 14 2017 16:35:18 GMT+0000 (GMT)'
		○ Getter method
			§ Return info about date object like month or year
			§ Getday()
		○ Setter methods
			§ Can be used to change value of the date held in a Date object
	• RegExp object
		○  const pattern = /[a-zA -Z]+ing$/; or  const pattern = new RegExp('[a-zA -Z]+ing');
		○  const pattern = /JavaScript/;
		○ \^ negates the sequence 
			§ /[^A-Z]/ means not a capital letter
		○ Properties
			§ Global property makes the pattern return all matches 
				□ Pattern only looks for first occurrence of match
				□  g
			§ ignoreCase property makes pattern case insensitive 
				□ Default case sensitive
				□  i
			§ Multiline makes pattern multiline 
				□ Default pattern will stop at end of line
				□  m
			§ Examples
				□  pattern = /java/I >>>>>that means it is making it case insensitive
	• Metacharacters 
		○  . matches any character, except line breaks
		○  \w matches any word character, and is equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_]
		○  \W matches any non-word character, and is equivalent to [\^A-Za-z0-9_]
