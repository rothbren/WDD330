        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I followed the instructions to create a canvas drawing, but I kept getting the error that it was null.
                I'm not sure how to fix that?

            Transforms and transitions
            https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/html5-css3-for-the-real-world-2nd-edition/read/8
                • Transform 
                    ○ Translate, rotate, scale, or skew elements
                    ○ Can have one or more functions 
                    ○ Don’t work on inline elements 
                        § Add display: inline-block;
                • Translation
                    ○ Move elements left, right, up, or down
                    ○ Move without impacting the flow of document
                    ○ Can only be moved relative to its current position
                    ○ Translate(x, y);
                    ○ Translatex - translate only on the x axis
                    ○ Translatey - translate only on y axis
                • Scaling
                    ○ Scale(x, y);
                    ○ If only one value is there, it is used for both x and y
                    ○ Scalex(x) or scaley(y) scale only one or the other
                    ○ Grow outwards form or shrink inwards towards center
                        § Center will stay in the same place as dimensions change
                    ○ Don’t add multiple transforms
                        § Add space between each thing
                        .ad-ad2 h1:hover span {
                            color: #484848;  
                            transform: translateX(40px) scale(1.5);
                        }
                • Rotation
                    ○ Rotates around point of origin 
                    ○ Default point of origin in elements center
                    ○ Positive degrees move clockwise
                        § Negative degrees counterclockwise
                    ○ Transform: rotate(10deg)
                • Skew
                    ○ Transform: skew(x,y);
                    ○ If second parameter is omitted, skew only occurs on x axis
                • Changing the origin of the transform
                    ○ Tansform-origin
                        § Same as background-position
                        § Defaults center of object
                        § transform-origin: 0 0;
                    ○ Order matters
                        § Have to rotate before translating - translate direction will be on the rotated axis
            
            Transition
                • Transition-duration
                    ○ Sets how long the transition will take
                        § Default to transition
                    ○ Seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms)
                    ○ transition-duration: 0.2s;
                • Transition timing function
                    ○ Control pace of transition 
                    ○ Can start slow, fast, or slow to fast
                    ○ Ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out
                        § Default start slow and speed up
                    ○ Transition-delay
                        § Delay before transition begins
                • Transition shorthand
                    .ad-ad2 h1 span {
                        transition-property: transform; 
                        transition-duration: 0.2s;  
                        transition-timing-function: ease-out;
                        transition-delay: 50ms;
                    }
                    
                    Change to:
                    
                    .ad-ad2 h1 span {
                        transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
                    }
                • Multiple transitions 
                    transition-property: transform, color; 
                    transition-duration: 0.2s;  
                    transition-timing-function: ease-out;
                    transition-delay: 50ms;
                    
                    Short hand:
                    transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms, color 0.1s linear 50ms;
                    
                    ○ To give all transitions the same amount of time --  use all
                    
                    transition: all 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
                • Transitionend - fired when completed css transition
                    ○ Fired once per direction
            
            Animation
                • Keyframe: snapshot that defines a starting point or end point of any smooth transition
                
                1. Create a named animation 
                2. Attach it to an element in that elements property declaration block
                 
                • @keyframs myAnimation {animation keyframes here}
                • Don’t quote animation name
                • Animation-name: appearDisappear;
                • Defines length of time (sec or millie) takes to completes all the way through 0-100%
                • Background-position
                • Animation-direction - 0-100%; reverse 100-0%
                • Shorthand - name, duration, timing, delay, count, direction, fill mode, play state
                    .verbose {
                        animation-name: appearDisappear; 
                        animation-duration: 300ms; 
                        animation-timing-function: ease-in;
                        animation-iteration-count: 1;
                        animation-direction: alternate;
                        animation-delay: 5s;
                        animation-fill-mode: backwards;
                        animation-play-state: running;
                    }
                    
                    /* shorthand */
                    .concise {
                        animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;
                    }
                • Careful when naming!
                    ○ No forwards, running or alternate
            
            
            
            Canvas, svg, and drag and drop
            https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/html5-css3-for-the-real-world-2nd-edition/read/12
                • Canvas
                    ○ See canvas.html for code
                    ○ Can draw lines, shapes, arcs, text, gradient, patterns
                    ○ Can manipulate pixels in images and video
                    ○ Steps
                        § Add canvas element -- <canvas></canvas>
                        § Give an id and class
                        § "sorry! Your browser doesn't support canvas" will show only if it is not supported 
                        § Add width and height 
                        § Add border 
                        § Drawing on the canvas is done through javascript
                    ○ Anonymous function
                        § Don’t have names
                        § Defined as an event listener 
                        § Code inside function will be run when the load event is fired 
                    ○ toDataURL
                        § Saves drawing
                        § Creates a URL with the image in it
                    ○ Does have a lack of accessibility 
                • Svg
                                    
                    ○ Viewbox - defines location, width, and height
                    ○ Circle - defines circles with cx and cy; r = radius
                    http://inkscape.org/ for svg images
                    
                • Raphaels container
                            
                • Canvas v. svg
                    ○ Both can draw shapes, paths, and fronts
                    ○ Canvas
                        § Allows pixel manipulation
                        § Immediate mode - can add whatever you want
                • Drag and drop
                    1. Set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you’d like to be draggable.
                    2. Add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable HTML elements.
                    3. Add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any elements that you want to have accept dropped items.

                • DataTransfer object
                    ○ Type of object outlines in drag and drop api
                    ○ Allow us to set and get data about the element that is being dragged
