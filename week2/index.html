        Ch2: Programming Basics
        • The importance of well-commented code
            ○ Comments are ignored by the language
            ○ Single line - //
            ○ Multiple lines = /**/
        • JavaScript grammar ― expressions, statements, semicolons and whitespace
            ○ End each statement with a ;
            ○ Use ASI (automatic semicolon insertion): attempts to place semicolons at the end of each line; error prone; most of the time doesn’t work
            ○ Write each statement on a new line and end with semicolon
            ○ Block series is held in {}
                § Do not need a semicolon at braces
            ○ Whitespace: used to separate code; use as much as needed so it is neat and easy to read
        • Primitive data types
            ○ String
            ○ Symbol
            ○ Number
            ○ Boolean
            ○ Undefined
            ○ Null
            ○ If it isnt one of the things listed above then it is an object
            ○ Operantd: operation to a value
            ○ Variables: value stored in memory
        • Strings ― string literals, string properties and methods
            ○ Collection of charactes - like letters and symbols
            ○ \
                § Can be used to escape special characters in strings like quote marks
            ○ Properties
                § Information about the object or value 
            ○ Methods
                § Perform an action on the object or value - to change or tell us something about it
            ○ String dot notation - writing a dot followed by the property you are interest in
                § Name.length
                    □ Would tell you how many letters were in the variable assigned to name
                    □ Allows you to use quotes in a string
                    □ Can contain line breaks
            ○ Template literals
                § Use the backtick `
        • Declaring and assigning constants and variables
            ○ Variables have to be declared before use
                § Use const and let
                § Const- value cannot be assigned to anything else
                § Let- value can be reassigned
            ○ If the variable references a non-primitive data type (array, function or object) then using const will not make it immutable
                § Underlying data inside the object can change or mutate
                
                const name = { value: 'Alexa' }; // an object
                name.value = 'Siri'; // change the value
                << 'Siri'
            ○ Scope: where a constant or variable is accessible by the program
                § Using const and let to declare variables = block scoped
                    □ Value only exists in the block they are declared in 
                § Global scope: any variable declared outside of a blcok
                    □ Accessible everywhere in the program
                    □ Not considered good proactice
                    □ Has the potential to overwrite other values - not good
                § Local scope: any variable defined inside a block using let or const
                § Will only be available inside that block
                § 
        • Direct assignment and assignment by reference
            ○ Primitive values will change directly with any changes to the value
            ○ Non-primitive: done by reference; any changes made will affect all references to that object
        • Symbols
            ○ Used to create unique values - avoid name collisions
            ○ Don’t have a literal form
            ○ Create them using symbol()
                § Typeof uniqueID;
                § <<'symbol'
        • Numbers ― decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary and exponent form, Infinity, and NaN
            ○ Can be integers or floating point numbers (decimals)
            ○ Can have constructor function
            ○ If a number starts with 0x - it is a hexadecimal notation
                § Used for color codes on the web
            ○ If it starts with zero followed by the letter o - it is octal 
            ○ If it starts with 0 and followed by the letter b - considered binary notation
            ○ NaN - not a number
        • Arithmetic operations such as +, -, *, /, and %
            ○ ++ will increment value by 1
                § Points++ will return orginal value then increase it by 1
                §  ++points will increase the value by 1 then return the new value
        • Converting between strings and numbers
            ○ Number methoda: number('32'); <<32
                § Can do the opposite to make a number into a string
        • Parsing numbers
            ○ parseInt() - used to convert a string representation of a numerical value back into a number
            
        • Undefined and null
            ○ Value given to variables that have not been assigned a value
            ○ Null- no value
                § Placeholder for JavaScript to say there should be a value but there isn't
        • Booleans ― truthy and falsy values
            ○ True and false 
            ○ Truthy - values that are always tru
            ○ Falsy- values that are always false
        • Logical operators ― AND, OR, and NOT
            ○ Any primitive value or object
            ○ Results are based no whether the values are considered truthy or falsy
            ○ !(Logical not)
                § ! In front of a value will convert it to a boolean and return the opposite value
                    □ Known as negation
            ○ &&(logical and)
                § Have to have this and that
            ○ || (logical or)
                § This or that
                § Only have to satisy one of the rules to work
                § Only true if any of the operands are true
                § False if both are false
            ○ Lazy evaluation
                § When you only check the minimum number of criteria that needs to be met
                § The computer will stop evaluating once a result is clear
            ○ Bitwise operators
                § Numbers written in binary that have 32 digits made up of just 0 and 1
                § 5 is written as 00000000000000000000000000000101
                § Used for low level programming tasks or applications that require a number of on off states
                § Not used often
            ○ Bitwise not
                § ~
                § Will convert number to a 32 bit integer then change all the 1s to 0s and all the 0s to 1s and return the value
            ○ Bitwise and
                § &
                § Converts both numbers into binary and returns number that in binary has a 1 in each position 
            ○ Bitwise or
                § Will convert both numbers into binary and reutrn a number that in binary has a 1 in each position for which the corresponding bits of either operands are 1
        • Eqaulity
            ○ Soft - check if answer is correct with ==
                § Javascript will not take into account the data type and will attempt to coerce the two valuse to the same type when comparing
            ○ Hard- === returns true if and only if they are the same data types
            ○ Ineqaulity - != (soft) and !== (hard)
        • Great than and less than
            ○ Use > to see if it is greater thand
        • Typeof - 
        
        Chapter Summary
            ○ Comments are ignored by the program, but make your program easier to read and understand
            ○ Data types are the basic building blocks of all JavaScript programs.
            ○ There are six primitive data types: strings, symbols, numbers, Booleans, undefined and null.
            ○ Non-primitive data types, such as arrays, functions and objects, all have a type of 'object'.
            ○ Variables point to values stored in memory and are declared using the const or let keywords.
            ○ Values are assigned to variables using the = operator.
            ○ Strings and numbers have various properties and methods that provide information about them.
            ○ Symbols are unique, immutable values.
            ○ Boolean values are either true or false .
            ○ There are only seven values that are false in JavaScript and these are known as 'falsy' values.
            ○ Data types can be converted into other data types.
            ○ Type coercion is when JavaScript tries to convert a value into another data type in order to perform an operation.
            ○ Logical operators can be used to check if compound statements are true or false.
            ○ Values can be compared to see if they are equal, greater than or less than other values.

    Ch3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops 
        • Array literals
            ○ Array - ordered list of values
            ○ Write inside []
            ○ Const myArray = [array, values, here];
            ○ If array is empty - undefined is returned
            ○ Array literals
                § Using sqaure brakcets that already contain some initial values
            ○ To remove - delete operator
                § Delete avenger [3]; 
            ○ Destructuring arrays - take values out of an array and present them as individual values
            ○ Allows you to assign multiple values at the same time using arrays
        • Adding and removing values from arrays
            ○ Length property
                § Avengers.length = 8
        • Array methods
            ○ Pop()
                § To remove the last item of the array
                § Returns last item of array, but the array no longer contains that item
            ○ Shift()
                § Removes first item in the array
            ○ Push()
                § Appends a new value to the end of the array
                § Return value is the new length of the array
            ○ Unshift()
                § Appends new item to the beginning of the array
            ○ Concat()
                § Used to merge an array with one or more other arrays
            ○ Join()
                § Can be used to turn the array into a string
            ○ Slice()
                § Creates subarray; chops out a slice of the original array
                § Non-destructive
            ○ Splice()
                § Removes items from an array then inserts new items in their place
                § Destructive because it changes the values
            ○ Reverse()
                § Reverse the order of an array
            ○ Sort()
                § Sort the order of an array
            ○ indexOf()
                § To find the first occurrence of a value in an array 
                § If item is there it will return the index of the first occurrence
            ○ Includes()
                § Returns a boolean value depending on whether the array contains a particular element or not
            ○ Multidimensional arrays
                § Create a coordinate system
        • Sets
            ○ Set- data structure that represents a collection of unique values - cannot include duplicates
            ○ Const list = new Set();
            ○ Adding values
                § List.add(a)   <<Set{1}
            ○ Methods
                § Values can be found using size()
                § Has() - check if a value is in a set; will return true or false
                § Memory leak - occurs when a program retians references to values that can no longer be accessed in its memory 
                    □ Memory is being used to stor values that are no longer reuqires
                    □ Cause problems
        • Maps
            ○ Keep list of key and value pairs
            ○ Const romanNumerals = new Map();
            ○ Set() to add key and value pair
                § romanNumeral.set(1,'I');
                << Map {1 => 'I'}
            ○ Get() - used to look up a value
        •  if and else statements
            ○ If - will run only if the condition in the () is true
                § If it is nota boolean condition, then it will be converted to boolean
            ○ Else - can be used to add an alternative blcok of code to run it if the condition is false
            ○ ? - used in place of an if…else statement
        •  switch statements
            ○ Good when there are lots of conditions for a test
            ○ Case keyword is used for each possible value
        •  while loops
            ○ Will run a block of code while the condition is true
            ○ Condition has to be met at some point to avoid getting infinite loops
        •  do … while loops
            ○ Condition comes after the block of code
            ○ Will always run once
        •  for loops
            ○ For (initialization; condition; after) {do something}
            ○ Nested
                § Loop inside a loop
                § Inner loop will run all the way through before the next step of the outer loop
            ○ Can loop over sets, maps and arrays
        • Iterating over a collection
    
    Example
        Const quiz = [
            ["what is superman's real name?", "Clark Kent"],
            ["what is wonder womans real name?", "Diana Prince"].
            ["what is batman's real name?", "Bruce Wayne"]
        ];
        
        Let score = 0 
        
        For(const [question, answer] of quiz) {
           const response = prompt(question);
            If(response === answer) {
                 alert ('Correct!');
            } else {
                Alert ('Wrong! The correct answer was ${answer}');
                }
        }
        
    Chapter Summary
    • Arrays are an ordered list of values
    • Multidimensional arrays are arrays that contain other arrays
    • Arrays have lots of methods that can be used to manipulate items in the array
    • Sets are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of non-duplicate values
    • Maps are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of key-value pairs
    • We can use an if and else statement to control the flow of code
    • The switch statement can be used instead of multiple if and else statements
    • A while loop and do ... while loop can be used to repeat a block of code while a condition is still true
    • A for loop works in a similar way to a while loop, but has a different syntax
    • A for-of loop can be used to iterate over an array
    • Sets and maps are enumerable, so can also be looped over using a for-of loop
    
    
    Ch4: Functions
    • Defining functions―function declarations, function expressions, Function() constructors and the new arrow syntax
        • Start with declaring function and function name
        • Function expression
            ○ Assigns an anonymous function to a variable
        • Function() constructors
            ○ Body of the function is entered as a string
                § Const hi = new Function('console.log("hi world");');
            ○ Not recommended
    • Invoking a function
        • Run the code inside the functions body
        • Enter its name followed by parentheses 
            § Hello();
                □ Hello world
        •  have to have () to invoke a function
    • Return values
        • Return a value using --- return 'howdy world'; 
    • Parameters and arguments
        • Represent values provided for the function as an input
        • Any parameters a function needs are set when the function is defined
        • When a function is invoked it is provided with arguments
        • Improved mean function
            § Will accept any number of values
            § Collects all the arguments that are entered into an array (values)
        • Default parameters 
            § Values that will be used by the function if no parameters are defined
            § To specify a default, assign the default value to the function definition 
            § Always put default parameters after other parameters
        • Arrow functions
            § =>
            § Parameters come before /> and main body function comes after
            § Anonymous
                □ If you want to refer to them you have to assign them a variable
                □ Less verbose
    • Hoisting―variables and functions
        • Hoisting - action of moving all variable and function declarations to the top of the current scope, regardless of where they are defined
        • Functions that use function declaration are automatically hoisted
            § They can be invoked before they have been defined
        • Variable hoisting 
            § Variable declarations that use var are automatically moved to the top of the current scope
            § Variables at the end of a function will be undefined until the assignment is made
            § Relies on var to declare variables
    • Callbacks―functions as a parameter
        • Callback - a function that passed an argument 
        • Provided as a parameter then invoked inside the body of the function
        • Sorting arrays 
            § Use sort() 
            § Tells how to compare the two values and the callback should return 
                □ A negative value if a comes before b
                □ 0 if a and b are equal
                □ A positive value if a comes after b
        • forEach() 
            § Will loop through the array and invoke a callback function using each value as an argument
        • Map() 
            § Iterates over an array and takes a callback function as a parameter
            § It returns a new array that replaces each value with a return value
        • Reduce()
            § Cumulatively combines each result to return just a single value
            § Takes second parameter after the callback 
        • Filter()
            § Returns new array that contains items from original array that return true when passed to the callback
    • Chaining iterators together
        • Iterator functions return an array which means that another iterator function
    • Mean() function
        • Improved version is reduce()
        • Reduce()
            § Adds up all values provided 
        • Can add a callback 
    
    Chapter summary
    • Functions are first-class objects that behave the same way as other values.
    • Function literals can be defined using the function declaration, or by creating afunction expressionby assigning an anonymous function to a variable.
    • All functions return a value. If this is not explicitly stated, the function will return undefined.
    • A parameter is a value that is written in the parentheses of a function declaration and can be used like a variable inside the function’s body.
    • An argument is a value that is provided to a function when it is invoked.
    • The arguments variable is an array-like object that allows access to each argument provided to the function using index notation.
    • The rest operator can be used to access multiple arguments as an array.
    • Default arguments can be supplied to a function by assigning them to the parameters.
    • Arrow functions are a new shorthand notation that can used for writing anonymous functions in ES6.
    • Function declarations can be invoked before they are defined because they are hoisted to the top of the scope, but function expressions cannot be invoked until after they are defined.
    • A callback is a function that is provided as an argument to another function.
